My son lives in London
She plays basketball
He catches the train every morning
Michael doesn’t work
My father doesn’t speak good English
He goes to football every day
He loves to play basketball
He goes to school
Does he go to school?
She writes an e-mail to her best friend
He thinks he is very handsome
It usually rains every day here
It smells very delicious in the kitchen
We generally sing songs all together
We go to a gallery every Sunday
Does he write an email?
The sun rises at the east
George brushes her teeth twice a day
He gets up early every day
They speak English in USA
It snows a lot in winter in Russia
We live in Texas
You go to holiday every summer
My daughter does the laundry
My brother takes out the trash
She swims every morning
I don’t wash the dishes
He doesn’t teach math
Cats hate water
Every child likes an icecream
My mother never lies
I don’t like tea
You don’t have children
I and my sister don’t see each other anymore
They don’t go to school tomorrow
My cat runs very fast
Julie talks very fast
My brother’s dog barks a lot
She goes to work by car
It doesn’t rain here in the summer
We cook every day
We go to the gym club together
You have a big house
They sleep in the afternoon
When do they usually talk to each other?
The children are at home
I like reading detective stories
I like geography and science
She doesn’t study German on Monday
Does she live in London?
